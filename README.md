# Solana Flash Loan Arbitrage Bot

A cloud-based development environment for building flash loan arbitrage bots on Solana. No local setup required - everything runs in your browser with proper version management to avoid common development issues.

## What it does

This project helps you:
* Find price differences between Solana DEXs (Jupiter, Raydium, Orca)
* Execute flash loans to profit from arbitrage opportunities
* Develop and test strategies without installing anything locally
* **Solve common Solana development environment issues** (version conflicts, SSL errors)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

1. Click the green "Code" button above
2. Select "Codespaces" tab
3. Click "Create codespace on main"
4. **Run the setup script** to avoid version conflicts:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
5. Wait 10-15 minutes for complete environment setup
6. Start coding in VS Code (in your browser)

### Option 2: Other Cloud Platforms

* **Replit**: Good for beginners - replit.com
* **Gitpod**: Advanced features - gitpod.io

## What you get

* **Rust 1.79.0** - Stable version compatible with Solana toolchain
* **Solana CLI 1.18.26** - Installed from GitHub (avoids SSL issues)
* **Anchor 0.30.1** - Compatible framework version
* **Pre-configured VS Code** - Ready-to-use development environment
* **Version conflict resolution** - No more cargo-build-sbf errors

## Environment Setup (Critical)

**⚠️ Important**: This setup resolves common issues:
- Rust version mismatches with cargo-build-sbf
- Solana SSL certificate errors
- Anchor compatibility problems

### Automated Setup
```bash
# Run the provided setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Manual Verification
```bash
# Verify installations
rustc --version          # Should show 1.79.0
solana --version         # Should show 1.18.26
anchor --version         # Should show 0.30.1
cargo-build-sbf --version  # Should work without errors
```

## Basic Usage

### Create Your First Arbitrage Bot
```bash
# Create a new project
anchor init my-arbitrage-bot
cd my-arbitrage-bot

# Replace default Anchor.toml with optimized version
# (Use the provided Anchor.toml configuration)

# Generate program keypair
anchor keys list

# Update program ID in Anchor.toml and lib.rs

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Build and test
anchor build
anchor test
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Get devnet SOL for testing
solana airdrop 2

# Check your balance
solana balance

# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy

# Run tests
anchor test --skip-local-validator
```

## Project Structure

├── programs/              # Your Solana programs (smart contracts)
│   └── arbitrage_bot/     # Main arbitrage logic
├── tests/                 # Test files
├── app/                   # Client code (TypeScript/JavaScript)

└── Anchor.toml           # Anchor configuration
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup** - Run setup.sh to configure environment properly
2. **Code** - Write your arbitrage logic in programs/
3. **Test** - Run comprehensive tests on devnet
4. **Deploy** - Deploy to devnet for integration testing
5. **Monitor** - Watch for arbitrage opportunities
6. **Execute** - Run your bot (start small!)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### cargo-build-sbf Version Mismatch
**Problem**: rustc version differs between system and cargo-build-sbf
**Solution**: Use Rust 1.79.0 as specified in setup.sh

### Solana Installation SSL Errors
**Problem**: SSL certificate issues with official installer
**Solution**: Install from GitHub releases (handled in setup.sh)

### Anchor Build Failures
**Problem**: Version compatibility issues
**Solution**: Use Anchor 0.30.1 with Rust 1.79.0

## Flash Loan Arbitrage Strategy

### Basic Concept
1. **Detect** price differences across DEXs
2. **Borrow** assets via flash loan
3. **Execute** arbitrage trades
4. **Repay** loan + fees
5. **Profit** from price difference

### Supported DEXs
- Jupiter Aggregator
- Raydium
- Orca
- Serum

## Testing Strategy

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test program logic
anchor test

# Test with devnet
anchor test --skip-local-validator
```

### Devnet Deployment
```bash
# Configure for devnet
solana config set --url devnet

# Deploy your program
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

## Risk Management

⚠️ **Critical Safety Notes**:
- This is for educational purposes
- Flash loan arbitrage involves significant financial risk
- Always test thoroughly on devnet first
- Start with minimal amounts on mainnet
- Understand all fees and slippage
- Monitor for MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) competition
- Check local financial regulations

### Recommended Testing Progression
1. Unit tests (anchor test)
2. Devnet integration tests
3. Mainnet paper trading
4. Small mainnet trades
5. Gradual scaling

## Performance Optimization

- **RPC Endpoints**: Use premium RPC for faster execution
- **Transaction Priority**: Set appropriate priority fees
- **Slippage Management**: Account for price movement
- **Gas Optimization**: Minimize compute units

## Getting Help
